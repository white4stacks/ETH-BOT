# Eth Bot

Eth Bot is a trading bot designed to take the emotion out of trading by employing Reinforcement Learning techniques. It utilizes a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to decide when to buy, sell, or hold Ethereum (ETH) based on historical market data and technical analysis indicators.

## Features
- Integration with the Alpaca trading API for live trading.
- Reinforcement Learning using a Deep Q-Network.
- Technical analysis indicators such as RSI, SMA, EMA, and MACD.
- Support for Gym environments, allowing for easy training and testing.

## Installation

To set up the Eth Bot project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd eth-bot
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
CopyReplit
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
CopyReplit
pip install pandas numpy lightgbm scikit-learn gym alpaca-trade-api ta torch
Usage
To run the Eth Bot, simply execute the following command:
CopyReplit
python bot.py
Replace bot.py with the name of your main Python file if it's different.
You can send trading instructions to the bot through a webhook by sending a POST request to the /webhook endpoint:
CopyReplit
POST /webhook
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "message": "BUY"    // or "SELL"
}
API Keys
Before running the bot, ensure to replace the placeholders for the Alpaca API key and secret key with your own credentials:
CopyReplit
ALPACA_API_KEY = "YOUR_ALPACA_API_KEY"
ALPACA_SECRET_KEY = "YOUR_ALPACA_SECRET_KEY"
It's strongly recommended to store these keys securely and not hard-code them into your scripts.
Trading Environment
The TradingEnv class provides a custom Gym environment which simulates trading in the Ethereum market. The environment's actions can be:
0: Hold
1: Buy
2: Sell
The state representation includes features derived from historical price data and technical indicators.
DQN Model
The DQN class defines the neural network architecture used for the Deep Q-Network. It consists of two hidden layers with ReLU activation functions.
